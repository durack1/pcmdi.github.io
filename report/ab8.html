<h1>Report 8:&nbsp; The Impact of Horizontal Resolution on
Moist Processes in the ECMWF Model</h1>
<ul><b>Phillips,</b> Thomas J., Lisa C. Corsetti and Stanley L. Grotch
<br>January 1993, 37 pp.&nbsp;
<hr>Summer and winter climates simulated at spectral scales T21, T42, T63
and T106 with the ECMWF (cycle 33) model are analyzed to determine the
impact of changes in horizontal resolution (in the absence of changes in
model physics) on atmospheric water vapor, clouds, convection, and precipitation.
Qualitative changes in many moist processes occur in the transition from
spectral T21 to T42, especially in the tropics where atmospheric convection
plays a central role; subsequent resolution increases mostly result in
an intensification of patterns established at T42.
<p>However, the seasonal climate simulations do not show evidence of "convergence"
to an asymptotic climate state at high resolution. Global convective precipitation
increases monotonically with resolution, but frontal precipitation, precipitable
water, and cloud cover display a qualitatively different pattern: after
undergoing abrupt reductions in the transition from T21 to T42, their global
averages show relative increases at finer resolutions. Precipitable water
and cloud cover also display a seasonal asymmetry in their responses to
increasing resolution. The comparative insensitivity of global cloud cover
to resolution is mainly a consequence of compensating tendencies of clouds
in different regions. With increasing resolution, decreases in low-latitude
clouds that result from drying of the tropical atmosphere are partially
offset by increases in high-latitude clouds associated with enhanced relative
humidity in response to an intensifying extratropical cold bias.
<p>The large-scale tropical moist processes are modeled more realistically
at T21 than in the finer-resolution simulations, wherein anomalous seasonal
climatic features such as a double ITCZ and underdeveloped summer monsoon
circulation are evident. Although some of these anomalies might ameliorate
if the physical parameterizations were suitably "tuned," these deficiencies
may reflect more fundamental problems related to a mismatch between the
resolution of the model and the implicit spatial and temporal scales of
the parameterizations.<a href="pdf/rep8.pdf">(pdf file)</a>
