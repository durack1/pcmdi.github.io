<br>Abstract
<p>We present an overview of results from the most recent phase of the
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). This phase of CMIP has archived
output from both unforced ("control run") and perturbed (1% per year increasing
atmospheric carbon dioxide) simulations by 15 modern coupled ocean-atmosphere
general circulation models. The models are about equally divided between
those employing and those not employing ad hoc flux adjustments at the
ocean-atmosphere interface. The new generation of non-flux-adjusted control
runs are narly as stable and agree with observations nearly as well as
the flux-adjusted models. This development represents significant progress
in the state of the art of climate modeling since the Second (1995) Scientific
Assesment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC;
see Gates et al. 1996) From the increasing-CO2 runs, we find that differences
between different models, while substantial, are not as great as would
be expected from earlier assesments that relied on equilibrium climate
sensitivity.
