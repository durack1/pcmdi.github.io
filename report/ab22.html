  The ECMWF general circulation model (cycle 33) was used to test the
  effect of horizontal resolution on the simulated cloud radiative forcing.
  The model was run with four resolutions: T21, T42, T63 and T106 and the
  results were compared to the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE).
  The ECMWF model produces relatively large errors in comparison to observations
  for January and July which can be attributed to the model being too dry
  and clouds too reflective. Only the T21 resolution displays substantial
  differences from the other resolutions, and all resolutions are substantially
  different from ERBE observations. <a href="pdf/rep22.pdf">(pdf file)</a></blockquote>
