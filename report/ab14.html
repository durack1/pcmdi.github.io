<hr>Recent investigations have considered whether it is possible to achieve
early detection of greenhouse-gas-induced climate change by observing changes
in ocean variables. In this study, we use model data to assess some of
the uncertainties involved in estimating when we could expect to detect
ocean greenhouse warming signals. We distinguish between detection periods
and detection times. As defined here, detection period is the length of
a climate time series which must be available in order to detect a given
linear trend in the presence of the natural climate variability. Detection
period is defined in model years and is independent of reference time and
the real time evolution of the signal. Detection time is computed for an
actual time-evolving signal from a greenhouse warming experiment and depends
on the experiment's start date.
<p>Two sources of uncertainty are considered--those associated with the
level of natural variability or noise, and those associated with the time-evolving
signals. We analyse the ocean signal and noise for spatially-averaged ocean
circulation indices such as ice volume, heat and fresh water fluxes, rate
of deep water formation, salinity, temperature, and transport of mass.
The signals for these quantities are taken from recent time-dependent greenhouse
warming experiments performed by the Hamburg group with a coupled ocean-atmosphere
General Circulation Model. The time-dependent greenhouse gas increase in
these experiments was specified in accordance with Scenario A of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The natural variability noise is derived
from a 300-year control run performed with the same coupled atmosphere-ocean
model and from two long (>3,000 year) stochastic forcing experiments in
which an uncoupled ocean model was forced by white-noise surface flux variations.
In the first experiment the stochastic forcing was restricted to the fresh
water fluxes, while in the second experiment the ocean model was additionally
forced by variations in wind stress and heat fluxes. The mean states and
ocean variability are very different in the three natural variability integrations.
<p>A suite of greenhouse warming simulations with identical forcing but
different initial conditions reveals that the signal estimated from these
experiments may evolve in noticeably different ways for some ocean variables
depending on the initial state. The combined signal and noice uncertainties
translate into large uncertainties in estimates of detection time. Nevertheless,
we find that ocean variables which are highly sensitive indicators of surface
conditions, such as convective overturning in the North Atlantic, have
shorter signal detection times (35-65 years) than deep-ocean indicators
(>=100 years).
<p>We investigate also whether the use of multivariate detection vector
increases the probability of early detection. We find that this can yield
detection times of 35-60 years (relative to a 1985 reference date) if signal
and noise are projected onto a common "guess pattern" which describes the
expected signal direction. Optimization of the signal-to-noise ratio by
(spatial) rotation in the direction of low noise components of the stochastic
forcing experiments yields a further reduction in detection time (to 10-45
years). However, rotation in space alone does not guarantee an improvement
of the signal-to-noise ratio for a time-dependent signal. This requires
an `optimal fingerprint' strategy in which the detection pattern (fingerprint)
is rotated in both space and time.<a href="pdf/rep14.pdf">(pdf file)</a>
