<h1>Report 23:&nbsp;&nbsp; Intercomparison of the Spectral
Characteristics of 200 hPa Kinetic Energy in AMIP GCM Simulations</h1>
<ul><b>Boyle, </b>James S.
<br>August 1995, 39 pp.&nbsp;
<hr>The 200 hPa kinetic energy budget terms are represented by means of
their spherical harmonic components for a number of AMIP simulations. The
data used are the monthly mean wind fields for 1979 to 1988 decadal simulations.
The budget terms are decomposed into the divergent and rotational components.
The comparison is limited to the lower wavenumbers so as to be within the
nominal limits imposed by the models with the coarsest spatial resolution.
<p>The results show considerable differences among the models. The comparison
is best for the rotational wind and degrades for the divergent components,
especially the conversion term. There is some ambiguity among the models
as to the sign of some terms at certain wavenumbers. The models tend to
overestimate the Walker-type (east-west) divergent circulations compared
to the Hadley-type (north-south), as indicated by recent NMC and ECMWF
operational analyses.
<p>The intermodel differences are substantial when viewed in light of the
differences in the oservational analyses and ensemble differences for the
ECMWF model. However, the median values of all the models taken together
are usually in fair agreement with observational values.
<p>There is no obvious, systematic pattern of errors which can be consistently
attributed to specifics of the individual model horizontal and vertical
resolution, numerics or physical parameterizations <i><a href="pdf/23.pdf">(pdf
