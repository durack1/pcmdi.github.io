<h1>Report 5:&nbsp; The Effects of Sampling Frequency on
the Climate Statistics of the ECMWF General Circulation Model</h1>
<ul><b>Phillips, </b>Thomas J., W. Lawrence Gates and Klaus Arpe
<br>September 1992, 26 pp.&nbsp;
<hr>The effects of sampling frequency on the first- and second-moment statistics
of selected ECMWF model variables are investigated in a simulation of "perpetual
July" with a diurnal cycle included and with surface and atmospheric fields
saved at hourly intervals. The shortest characteristic time scales (as
determined by the e-folding time of lagged autocorrelation functions) are
those of ground heat fluxes and temperatures, precipitation and run-off,
convective processes, cloud poperties, and atmospheric vertical motion,
while the longest time scales are exhibited by soil temperature and moisture,
surface pressure, and atmospheric specific humidity, temparature and wind.
The time scales of surface heat and momentum fluxes and of convective processes
are substantially shorter over land than over the oceans.
<p>An appropriate sampling frequency for each model variable is obtained
by comparing the estimates of first- and second-moment climate statistics
determined at intervals ranging from 2 to 24 hours with the "best" estimates
obtained from hourly sampling. Relatively accurate estimation of first-
and second-moment climate statistics (10 percent errors in means, 20 percent
errors in variances) can be achieved by sampling a model variable at intervals
that usually are longer than the bandwidth of its time series, but that
often are shorter than its characteristic time scale.
<p>For the surface variables, sampling at intervals that are non-integral
divisors of a 24-hour day yields relatively more accurate time-mean statistics
because of a reduction in errors accociated with aliasing of the diurnal
cycle and higher-frequency harmonics. The superior estimates of first-moment
statistics are accompanied by inferior estimates of the variance of the
daily means due to the presence of sytematic biases, but these probably
can be avoided by defining a different measure of low-frequency variability.
Estimates of the intradiurnal variance of accumulated precipitation and
surface run-off also are strongly impacted by the length of the storage
interval. In light of these results, some alternative strategies for storage
of the EMWF model variables are recommended.<a href="pdf/rep5.pdf">(pdf
