This report summarizes essential features of the global atmospheric
models of some 30 groups that are participating in the Atmospheric Model
Intercomparison Project (AMIP), an international effort to simulate the
climate of the period 1979-1988 with common ocean boundary conditions and
radiative forcings. Salient features of the AMIP models are summarized
in tabular form, and the principal numerical, dynamical, and physical properties
of each model are described in greater detail as well. An extensive bibliography
of references on the algorithms and parametrizations used in the AMIP models
is also provided.<a href="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/projects/modeldoc/amip/">HTML</a>, (<a href="pdf/18.pdf"><i>pdf</i></a>).
