<H3> ABSTRACT </H3>
<FONT SIZE = -1>
<P>
We present an overview of results from the most recent phase of the
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP).
This phase of CMIP has archived output from both unforced ("control run")
and perturbed (1% per year increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide)
simulations by 15 modern coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models.
The models are about equally divided between those employing and those not
employing ad hoc flux adjustments at the ocean-atmosphere interface.
The new generation of non-flux-adjusted control runs are nearly as stable
and agree with observations nearly as well as the flux-adjusted models.
This development represents significant progress
in the state of the art of climate modeling since
the Second (1995) Scientific Assessment Report 
of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC; see Gates et al. 1996).
From the increasing-CO<SUB>2</SUB> runs, we find that
differences between different models, while substantial, are not as great as
would be expected from earlier assessments that relied on equilibrium
climate sensitivity.

<H3> 1. Introduction </H3>
<P>
This report summarizes several aspects of results
from Phase 2 of the Coupled
Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP2; see Meehl et al. 2000).
CMIP was established in 1995 by the JSC/CLIVAR Working Group on Coupled
Models, a part of the World Climate Research Program.  CMIP may be
regarded as an analog of the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Program
(AMIP; see Gates et al. 1999) for coupled atmosphere - ocean - sea ice
general circulation models (coupled GCMs).
These models simulate the physical climate system given external boundary
conditions such as solar luminosity and concentrations of radiatively active
gases and aerosols, in contrast to atmosphere-only GCMs (AMIP-type models)
in which sea ice and sea
surface temperature are prescribed to match observations.
Coupled GCMs are the
primary models used to assess possible global warming due to the
anthropogenic greenhouse effect.
<P>
The first phase of CMIP (CMIP1) collected output from coupled GCM
"control runs" in which external climatic forcings such as greenhouse
gas concentrations are kept constant.
Nearly all output fields were archived as seasonal (December-January-February
and June-July-August) climatological means.
The next phase, CMIP2, collected output from both model control runs and matching runs
in which atmospheric carbon dioxide increases at the rate of 1% per year.
Under this common scenario of radiative forcing, any differences among the models are
due to differences in their responsiveness, e.g., their differing equilibrium climate
sensitivities and rates of ocean heat uptake, which in turn arise from differences in
resolution, other numerical aspects, and parameterizations of sub-gridscale processes.
CMIP2 thus facilities the study of intrinsic model differences at the price of
idealizing the forcing scenario.
No other anthropogenic climate forcing factors, such as anthropogenic
aerosols (which have a net cooling effect), are included.
Neither the control runs nor the increasing-CO<SUB>2</SUB> runs
in CMIP include natural varations in climate forcing, e.g.,
from volcanic eruptions or changing solar brightness.
Each CMIP2 model simulation extends for 80 years.
All CMIP2 model output variables were archived as four nonoverlapping
20-year means with the exception of surface air temperature, mean sea level
pressure and precipitation, for which all 960 monthly means were archived.
Details of the CMIP database, together with access information, may
be found on the CMIP Web site at http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip/diagsub.html.
<P>
The purpose of this report is to give an
overview of the CMIP2 simulations with emphasis on common model successes
and failures in simulating the present day climate, and on common features
of the simulated changes due to increasing CO<SUB>2</SUB>.
We pay extra attention to the 3 fields that CMIP
provides at monthly mean time resolution.
The other fields, lacking information about seasonal variations,
are necessarily described in terms of annual mean quantities.
Extensive analyses of seasonal variations in the CMIP1 control runs
is given by Covey et al. (2000) and Lambert and Boer (2000),
and more specialized studies of the CMIP database are summarized by
Meehl et al. (2000) and the CMIP Web site at http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip/abstracts.html.
<P>
In this report we include 15 models from CMIP2:
BMRC, CCCMA (CGCM1), CCSR, CERFACS (ARPEGE/OPA2), CSIRO (Mk2),
DOE PCM, ECHAM3+LSG, GFDL (R15a), GISS (Russell),
HadCM2, HadCM3, IAP/LASG, LMD/IPSL, MRI (Tokioka)
and NCAR CSM.  
(Documentation of these models is available on the CMIP Web site.)
We have not included the CMIP2
contributions from NRL or the older NCAR Washington and
Meehl model.  NRL's control run is only 3 years long, and
Washington and Meehl regard their older model as
superceded by the DOE PCM.
On some figures we have also included a model that has
not yet joined CMIP2:
ECHAM4+OPYC3.  This model has not yet been forced in
a 1% per year CO<SUB>2</SUB> increase scenario.  We include its
control run output in some of our figures at the request of
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which will 
include this model's simulations of
global warming in its upcoming Third Scientific Assessment Report.
Some of the figures below may also appear in the IPCC Report.
<P>
The rate
of radiative forcing increase implied by 1% per year increasing
CO<SUB>2</SUB> is nearly a factor
of two greater than the actual anthropogenic forcing in recent decades, even
if non-CO<SUB>2</SUB> greenhouse gases are added in as part of an "equivalent
CO<SUB>2</SUB> forcing" and anthropogenic aerosols
are ignored (see, e.g., Figure 3 of Hansen et al. 1997).
Thus the CMIP2 increasing-CO<SUB>2</SUB> scenario cannot be considered
as realistic for purposes of comparing model-predicted and observed
climate changes during the past century.
It is also not a good estimate of future anthropogenic climate
forcing, except perhaps as an extreme case in which the world
accelerates its consumption of fossil fuels while reducing its
production of anthropogenic aerosols.
Nevertheless, this idealized scenario generates an easily discernible
response in all the CMIP2 models and thus provides the opportunity to
compare and possibly explain different responses arising from
different model formulations.

<H3> 2. Present-day climate </H3>
<P>
In this section we compare output from the model control run simulations with
recent climate observations.  It has become
increasingly apparent that the detailed climate record of the past century
(and indeed the past millenium) cannot be explained without considering changes
in both natural and anthropogenic forcing (Tett et al. 1999; Santer et al. 2000; Crowley 2000).
Since the CMIP control run boundary conditions lack these forcing
variations, we focus on means and other statistics that we judge to be
largely unaffected by them.
In particular we do not discuss the climate variability simulated by
the CMIP control runs.  This topic has been addressed in more specialized
studies (Barnett 1999; Bell et al. 2000; Duffy et al. 2000).
<P>
For our observational data base we
use the most recent and reliable sources we are aware of, including
Jones et al. (1999) for surface air temperature, 
Xie and Arkin (1997) for precipitation,
and reanalysis of numerical weather
prediction initial conditions for sea level pressure.
We sometimes use multiple sources to provide a sense of observational
uncertainty, e.g., reanalysis from both the European Center for
Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ERA15; Gibson et al. 1997)
and the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP; Kalnay
et al. 1996).
<BR>
<P><I> a. Global and annual means </I>
<P>
Averaging over latitude and longitude to form global means reduces 
surface variables to one-dimensional time series.
Additional averaging of monthly means to form annual means removes seasonal cycle
variations (which can be substantial even for global means), providing a
convenient entry point to
three-dimensional model output.
<A HREF = "#Fig1Caption">Figure 1</A>
shows the resulting time series for CMIP2 control run surface air
temperature and precipitation.
<P>
The range among the models of global- and annual-mean surface air temperature
is rather surprising at first sight.
Jones et al. (1999) conclude that the average value for 1961-1990 was 14.0&#176C
and point out that this value differs from earlier estimates by only 0.1&#176C.
It therefore seems that 
several of the models (which simulate values from less than
12&#176C to over 16&#176C) are in significant disagreement with the observations
of this fundamental quantity.
Reasons for this situation are discussed briefly by Covey et al. (2000) in the
context of the CMIP1 models.
The models as a group also give a 
wide range of estimates for global- and annual-mean precipitation, compared with 
the best observed values from several
sources (2.66-2.82 mm / day from Table 2 in Xie and Arkin 1997).
Precipitation, however, is notoriously difficult to measure globally, and the observational
uncertainty of its global and annual mean 
may not be smaller than the range of model-simulated values in Figure 1.
<P>
Perhaps the most striking aspect of Figure 1 is the stability of model-simulated
temperature and precipitation.
The stability occurs despite the fact that 6 of the 15 CMIP2 models
refrain from employing ad hoc flux adjustments at the air-sea interface.
Until a few years ago, conventional wisdom held that in order to suppress
unrealistic climate drift, coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models 
must add such unphysical flux "corrections" to their governing equations.
The 1995 IPCC assessment (Gates et al. 1996) diplomatically expressed the
concern that "[f]lux adjustments are relatively large in the models that use them,
but their absence affects the realism of the control climate and the the
associated feedback processes".
The CMIP1 experiments were conducted at about the same time as this assessment
was written.
Covey et al. (2000) note that averaging the magnitudes of linear
trends of global- and annual-mean surface air temperature gives 0.24 and 1.1
&#176C / century, respectively, for flux-adjusted and non-flux-adjusted CMIP1
models.
For the CMIP2 models shown in Figure 1, however, the corresponding 
numbers for the average 
&#177 1 standard deviation over each class of model are 0.12 &#177 0.14 
&#176C / century for the
flux-adjusted models and 0.31 &#177 0.31 
&#176C / century for the non-flux-adjusted models.
Nevertheless, it must be kept in mind that a small rate of
global mean climate drift does not preclude strong local drifts at the
surface and problematic long term drift in the deep ocean.
<BR>
<P><I> b. Long-term time means </I>
<P>
Atmosphere: geographically distributed quantities
<P>
As noted above, most of the CMIP2 output variables are present in the database 
as 20-year means that average out the seasonal cycle.
In this subsection we examine surface variables and other two-dimensional (latitude-longitude)
quantities.
To summarize the performance of the models, we interpolate their output to
a common Gaussian grid with 128 longitudes and 64 latitudes 
and show both the model mean (the average
over all the models) and the intermodel standard deviation (<I>sd<SUB>m</SUB></I>).
Where possible, we compare the model means for the control simulations 
with observations. 
Lambert and Boer (2000) demonstrate that the
model mean exhibits good agreement with observations, often better than any of the 
individual models.
High values of <I>sd<SUB>m</SUB></I> indicate areas
where the models have difficulty in reaching a consensus, implying reduced levels
of confidence in the model results.
<P>
Results for which observations are available are presented as
four-panel displays. The upper-left panel shows the model mean and <I>sd<SUB>m</SUB></I>, the lower-left
panel shows the observed field and the departure of the model mean from this observed
field, and the lower-right panel shows zonal averages for the individual models
and the observations. 
These three panels contain only output from model control runs.
The upper-right panel gives the differences between the model mean for years 61-80 and
years 1-20 for the enhanced greenhouse warming simulations,
together with these differences normalized by their standard deviation among the models.
Results in the upper-right panels will be discussed in Section 3.
<P>
<A HREF = "#Fig2Caption">Figure 2</A> 
displays results for annual mean surface air temperature (also known as screen temperature).
Over most of the globe, the
model mean differs from the Jones observations by less than two K, although larger differences are
evident in polar regions. 
These annual departures are much less than the winter and summer season errors reported 
by Lambert and Boer (2000).
The zonally averaged results for the individual models show that
all are quite successful in reproducing the observed structure, except in the polar regions.
<I>sd<SUB>m</SUB></I> values show that the
models tend to disagree in the polar regions and over high terrain but produce
consistent simulations over ice-free oceans.
This consistency may occur because the ocean 
components of coupled models tend to be more similar than their atmospheric components,
or it may simply be due to the lack of terrain effects and strong horizontal gradients over
open oceans.
<P>
<A HREF = "#Fig3Caption">Figure 3</A>
displays results for annual mean sea level pressure. As demonstrated by <I>sd<SUB>m</SUB></I>,
the models are very consistent in their simulations. The largest variances occur in south
polar regions and much of this results from extrapolation below ground. Comparison with
the ECMWF/ERA reanalysis (Gibson et al. 1997) shows that the model mean is within
2 hPa of the observed field over most of the globe. The largest departures occur near Antarctica 
with lesser departures north of Scandinavia, Russia and western North America.
The zonally averaged results demonstrate the agreement among the models.
With the exception of one model and in the southern polar regions, the models agree with each other
to within ~5 hPa.
Also evident from the zonally averaged results, however, is the difficulty that models have in simulating
both the position and depth of the Antarctic trough.
<P>
<A HREF = "#Fig4Caption">Figure 4</A>
displays results for annual mean precipitation. It is evident from the relatively large 
<I>sd<SUB>m</SUB></I> that the models have difficulty in producing consistent simulations.
This result is expected because precipitation is a small scale process.
Likely contributors to inconsistency among models include differences in horizontal resolution 
and sub-gridscale parameterization schemes.
Precipitation is a difficult field to observe and thus one must be somewhat cautious in using 
it for evaluation purposes. 
(Comparison of surface air temperature, sea level pressure and precipitation
with alternate observational datasets is given in Subsection (c) below.)
Using the Xie and Arkin (1997) observations, we find that 
in general the
models simulate ~1 mm / day too much precipitation in mid-latitudes and somewhat too little in the tropics.
The models correctly simulate 
the position of the annual mean ITCZ slightly north of the Equator, but
a striking disagreement with observations occurs in the South Pacific.
Here the model mean has a second maximum band parallel to the Equator, but the observations have a
maximum with a northwest-southeast orientation north of New Zealand. 
The zonally averaged results show that this "double ITCZ" problem is shared by several of the models.
<P>
<A HREF = "#Fig5Caption">Figure 5</A>
displays the annual net heat flux into the oceans.
For the model mean, the largest oceanic heat gain is
in the eastern tropical Pacific and the largest losses occur over the Kuroshio, the Gulf Stream
and the southern Indian Ocean. <I>sd<SUB>m</SUB></I> is highest in the loss areas. 
Observations
of this field, and for its components to be discussed shortly, are best considered as estimates 
and this fact should be kept in mind when using them to evaluate models. 
Comparison with the observational estimates from da Silva et al. (1994) indicates that the
model mean underestimates the heat losses from the oceans (as indicated by
positive values of the differences between the model mean and observations) in regions where
the ocean loses heat.
The zonally averaged results show a large scatter among the models and a tendency for
most of them to underestimate the heat loss from the oceans in the Northern 
Hemisphere and subtropical Southern Hemisphere and to overestimate the heat loss in the
mid-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere.
There is also an indication that the models generally place
the equatorial maximum in heat uptake slightly too far to the north.
<P>
It is useful to examine separately each of the components of the annual mean surface energy balance.
These components -- net shortwave radiative flux, net longwave radiative flux, latent heat flux
and sensible heat flux -- are presented in 
<A HREF = "#Fig6Caption">Figures 6-9</A>
respectively for both land and ocean areas.
Although the models all show the well known equator-pole contrast in annual mean shortwave flux,
comparison of the model mean with the GEWEX Surface Radiation Budget (SRB) observational estimates 
(Whitlock et al. 1995) 
indicates that the shortwave flux is ~10% too high in the tropics and ~20% too low in 
temperate and polar latitudes, an error that is apparent in the zonally averaged results
for most of the models.
In addition, <I>sd<SUB>m</SUB></I> values for shortwave flux reveal substantial
inter-model variation within tropical latitudes in regions of strong convective activity. 
For longwave flux, both <I>sd<SUB>m</SUB></I> and zonally averaged results show a very
large scatter among the individual models, especially at high latitudes.
The GEWEX SRB observations indicate that the model mean longwave flux is too large in the 
tropics and sub-tropics and too small in mid-latitudes and polar regions. 
The model mean errors in the downward shortwave flux and upward longwave flux will tend 
to oppose one another when the net surface radiative balance is computed.
Latent heat flux exhibits the expected patterns including (for the model mean)
large fluxes over warm cloud-free areas in the subtropical high pressure belts and low
values over cloudy areas. 
Comparison with the NCEP reanalysis (Kalnay et al. 1996) indicate that the model mean has, with the
exception of deserts, too little evaporation over land and too much over the oceans.
The final and smallest component of the surface heat balance is sensible heat flux.
Over land there is substantial inter-model variation of this quantity (<I>sd<SUB>m</SUB></I> is
nearly as large as the model mean flux) and, except for deserts, the models simulate values that
are higher than those obtained by the NCEP reanalysis. 
Over ice-free oceans the model mean agrees much better with the reanalysis.
<P>
Finally we consider two additional surface fluxes that drive ocean circulation.
For nearly all models
the annual mean fresh water flux <A HREF = "#Fig10Caption">(Figure 10)</A>
shows large positive fluxes (i.e., precipitation exceeding evaporation)
near the Equator with smaller positive values 
associated with mid-latitude storm tracks, and large negative values in the subtropical
high pressure belts. 
The largest values of <I>sd<SUB>m</SUB></I> for this quantity tend to be found in regions
where the fresh water flux is into the oceans. 
Comparison with a crude observational
estimate obtained by combining Xie-Arkin precipitation and NCEP reanalysis evaporation shows 
an error pattern very similar to that of precipitation, suggesting that deficiencies in
the fresh water flux arise primarily from simulation of precipitation.
For zonal annual mean surface wind stress <A HREF = "#Fig11Caption">(Figure 11)</A>
the largest values of the <I>sd<SUB>m</SUB></I> over the oceans are found in the vicinity of Antarctica,
the area where the model mean differs most from the NCEP reanalysis. 
These problems apparently result from the difficulties the models have in simulating the depth and position of
the Antarctic trough in mean sea level pressure. 
<P>
Atmosphere: zonally averaged quantities
<P>
We now turn to three-dimensional quantities, presented here (after zonal averaging)
as latitude-height cross sections.
<A HREF = "#Fig12Caption">Figure 12</A> shows zonally averaged annual mean air temperature.
The pattern of model mean isotherms is qualitatively close to observations, but
compared with the ECMWF/ERA reanalysis, the model
mean is generally too cold in the troposphere and polar stratosphere
and too warm at lower latitudes in the stratosphere. 
The magnitude of these errors is comparable to 
<I>sd<SUB>m</SUB></I>, implying that the models produce fairly consistent simulations of temperature
and that the errors are common to most of the models.
Results for the
individual models at 925 hPa confirm this situation for the
cold bias at low levels.
Corresponding results for specific humidity <A HREF = "#Fig13Caption">(Figure 13)</A>
display a fairly systematic underestimate in the low latitude troposphere, although
the departure of the model mean from ECMWF/ERA reanalysis is rather small (~1 g / kg)
and the pattern of the model mean in latitude-height space is again quite similar to observations.
<P>
<A HREF = "#Fig14Caption">Figure 14</A> shows zonally averaged annual mean zonal wind. 
In the lower troposphere the models agree rather well with each other and with the
ECMWF/ERA reanalysis (to within ~2 m / s) except in the vicinity of the Antarctic Trough.
Both <I>sd<SUB>m</SUB></I> and the difference between the model mean and observations
exhibit a noticeable increase with height.
As a result the model simulations at upper levels depart qualitatively as well as
quantitatively from observations, e.g., 
the double jet structure of the Southern Hemisphere is not
well captured by the model mean. 
Results for the individual models at 200 hPa show
the large scatter and further illustrate the problems in the Southern Hemisphere.
The mass streamfunction <A HREF = "#Fig15Caption">(Figure 15)</A> 
exhibits moderate inter-model variance at most latitudes and
altitudes, with <I>sd<SUB>m</SUB></I> ~ 20% of model mean values, and results for
the individual models at 600 hPa show qualitative consistency in the size and position of the
annual mean Hadley and Ferrel cells.
Comparison of the model mean with 
ECMWF/ERA reanalysis indicates that the model-simulated Hadley circulation is in general too weak.
<P>
Ocean quantities
<P>
Turning to ocean variables, we examine the annual mean temperature 
<A HREF = "#Fig16Caption">(Figure 16)</A> and salinity 
<A HREF = "#Fig17Caption">(Figure 17)</A> at 1000 meters depth.
(Sea surface temperature is closely coupled to surface air temperature over the oceans
and is not explicitly discussed in this report.)
For temperature at this level the models are generally consistent in their simulations
(<I>sd<SUB>m</SUB></I> < 1 K) except in the
North Atlantic, subtropical Pacific and Indian Oceans, and in the Arabian Sea.
Available observations (Levitus and Boyer 1994) indicate that the model mean is too warm over
most of the ocean.
The zonally averaged results show that outside the polar regions, all but one of the models 
simulate 1000 meter temperatures that are at or above (by up to ~2 K) the observations.
An overly diffusive thermocline may be the root of this problem.
The corresponding results for salinity exhibit relatively
large <I>sd<SUB>m</SUB></I> values and some spectacular departures from observations for
individual models.
Compared with observations (Levitus et al. 1994) the model mean is too saline in the Atlantic 
and Southern Oceans, and not saline enough in the Arabian Sea and Eastern Atlantic.
<P>
For the annual means of barotropic streamfunction 
<A HREF = "#Fig18Caption">(Figure 18),</A> 
global overturning streamfunction 
<A HREF = "#Fig19Caption">(Figure 19)</A> 
and Atlantic overturning streamfunction 
<A HREF = "#Fig20Caption">(Figure 20)</A>
we use three-panel displays because there are no complete observations of these quantities.
Nevertheless it is noteworthy that the model means for all three agree qualitatively with
conventional wisdom among oceanographers.
Quantitative disagreement among models is most striking for the barotropic streamfunction
off Antarctica, the global overturning streamfunction in the Southern Hemisphere and the
Atlantic overturning streamfunction at ~1000 meters depth.
<P>
Poleward heat transport by the global ocean is given in 
<A HREF = "#Fig21Caption">Figure 21.</A> In the upper left-hand 
panel, the upper dashed line is the model mean plus one <I>sd<SUB>m</SUB></I> and the lower
dashed line is the model mean minus one <I>sd<SUB>m</SUB></I>.
The model mean, which is not plotted, is half way between the two dashed lines.
Observations of Trenberth and Solomon (1994) are shown as a bold solid line in both the upper-left
and bottom panels.
From these observations, it appears that over most of the ocean the model-simulated transport 
is generally too weak.
The observations are uncertain, however.
For example, an update (Trenberth 1998) of the Trenberth and Solomon data reduces the peak
ocean heat transport in the Southern Hemisphere by nearly a factor of 2.
<BR>
<P><I> c. Global statistics </I>
<P>
To begin to
obtain a more quantitative picture of how well (or how poorly) the models agree
with observations, we use a diagram developed by Taylor (2000).
This technique, and others exhibited in this section, are part of the
climate diagnostic software developed at the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and
Intercomparison (PCMDI).
Selected PCMDI software tools and their documentation can be downloaded from the Web site
<CODE>http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/software</CODE>.
We intend to make the software tools that produced Figures 22, 24, etc., public
via this Web site.
<P>
<A HREF = "#Fig22Caption">Figure 22</A> is a Taylor diagram of the total spatial and
temporal variability of 
three fields: surface air temperature, sea level pressure and
precipitation.
The variability shown in the figure includes the seasonal cycle but excludes the
global mean.
The radial coordinate is the ratio of modeled to observed standard deviation.
The cosine of the angle of the model point
from the horizontal axis is the spatio-temporal correlation
between model and observation.
When plotted in these coordinates, the diagram also indicates the root-mean-square 
difference between model and observation: this difference is proportional to the
linear distance between the model point and the "observed" point lying on the horizonal
axis at unit distance from the origin.
Thus the diagram enables visualization of three quantities -- standard deviation
normalized by observation, correlation with observation, and r.m.s. difference
from observation -- in a two-dimensional space.
This is possible because the three quantities are not independent of each other
(Taylor 2000).
Loosely speaking, the polar coordinate of the diagram gives the correlation
between model and observation for space-time variations but
contains no information about the amplitude of the variations, the radial
coordinate compares the modeled and observed amplitude of the variations, and the
distance between each model point and the "observed" point gives the r.m.s. model
error.
<P>
The most striking aspect of the figure is the way it separates the three fields
into separate groups.
This separation agrees with the familiar qualitative statement that models simulate
temperature best, sea level pressure less well, and precipitation worst (e.g.,
Gates et al. 1996).
For surface air temperature, all models a achieve a correlation with
observation > 0.93, and the standard deviation of space-time variations is within
&#177 15% of the observed value in nearly all models.
(This achievement is especially noteworthy for the non-flux-adjusted models, which have
no explicit constraints requiring surface temperatures to match observations.)
For modeled
sea level pressure, the correlation with observation falls mainly in the range 0.7-0.9;
for modeled precipitation it falls in the range 0.4-0.7.
The standard deviation of space-time variations is also
modeled less well for precipitation and sea level pressure than it is 
for surface air temperature.
<P>
To provide a sense of observational uncertainty, we include two alternate
observed data sets in Figure 22: ECMWF/ERA reanalysis ("e") and 
NCEP reanalysis ("n").
These data sets are plotted as if they were model output.
For all three fields, the alternate observed data sets fall closer to the baseline
"observed" point than any model does -- but not much closer than the closest
model.
For precipitation and surface air temperature, the r.m.s. difference between either 
of the reanalysis data sets and the baseline observations is more than half the
smallest r.m.s. model error.
Whether this result says something positive about the models or negative about
reanalysis is unclear.
More comparison between alternate sets of observations is provided in the
following figures.
<P>
Figure 22 displays the total space-time variance of the model runs.
It is also useful to examine individual components of the variance.
<A HREF = "#Fig23Caption">Figure 23</A>
shows how we divide a surface field (either model-simulated or
observed) into components.
Our procedure follows the usual practice in climatology, obtaining 
representations of increasingly detailed space-time behavior:
<OL>
<LI> the global and annual mean (not included in Figure 22)
<LI> the zonal and annual mean, giving variations with latitude
<LI> the annual mean deviations from the zonal mean, giving variations with
longitude (mainly land-sea contrast)
<LI> the annual cycle of the zonal mean, giving seasonal variations as a function
of latitude
<LI> the annual cycle of deviations from the zonal mean, giving the remaining
variance (apart from interannual variations, which are not considered here)
</OL>
<P>
In Figures 24-26
we divide the r.m.s. difference between each model and observation ("total error" of
the model) into these components.
The error component associated with the global and annual mean is called the
bias, and the remaining error (the sum of components 2-5) is called the pattern
error.
The figures give -- from top to bottom -- the total error, the bias, the pattern
error, and the remaining error components.
For each component, errors are normalized by that component's observed standard
deviation.
The error amounts are color-coded so that blue indicates a small error compared
with the observed standard deviation and red indicates a large error compared with
the observed standard deviation.
<P>
Applying this metric to surface air temperature
<A HREF = "#Fig24Caption">(Figure 24),</A> we find that nearly all error components
in nearly all models are small, particularly the annual and zonal mean
components.
For three of the models -- ECHAM4+OPYC3, HadCM2 and HadCM3 -- all of the error
components are about as small as for ERA and NCEP renalyses when the latter
are included as extra "models".
Turning to sea level pressure 
<A HREF = "#Fig25Caption">(Figure 25),</A> we find that nearly all models 
have small errors for global and zonal means, but several of the models have
large errors for more detailed space-time patterns.
Surprisingly, even the NCEP reanalysis has a large "error" in one component
(annual cycle of the zonal mean) when compared with the baseline observations
from ERA.
Turning to precipitation 
<A HREF = "#Fig26Caption">(Figure 26),</A> we find that model errors are concentrated
in the annual cycle of deviations from the zonal mean.
Large errors in this component appear for all models except HadCM2 and the two
reanalyses.
Errors in the global and zonal means (including the seasonal cycle of the zonal
mean) are small for all models.
This situation is an improvement over earlier models in which even the global and
annual mean precipitation value could be substantially erroneous, e.g.,
~30% greater than observed in Version 1 of the NCAR Community Climate Model 
(Covey and Thompson 1989, Table I).
<P>
Figures 24-26 can also be used to
sort models into flux-adjusted and non-flux-adjusted
classes, as explained in the figure captions.
Differences between these two classes of models are not obvious from the figures.
This result reinforces the inferences made above that in modern coupled GCMs the
performance differences between flux-adjusted and non-flux-adjusted models are
relatively small (see also Duffy et al. 2000).
Evidently, for at least the century-timescale integrations used
to detect and predict anthropogenic climate change, several modeling groups now find
it possible to dispense with flux adjustments.
This development represents an improvement over the 
situation a decade ago, when most groups felt that coupled models could 
not satisfactorily reproduce the observed climate without 
including arbitrary (and often nonphysical) adjustment terms in their equations.

<H3> 3. Increasing-CO<SUB>2</SUB> climate </H3>
<P>
To begin our discussion of model responses to 1% per year
increasing atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB>, 
<A HREF = "#Fig27Caption">Figure 27</A>
shows global and annual mean changes in surface air temperature and
precipitation under this scenario, i.e., differences between the
increasing-CO<SUB>2</SUB> and control runs.
The surface air temperature results are similar to those shown in the 1995 IPCC
report (Kattenberg et al. 1996, Figure 6.4).
The models reach about 2 &#176C global mean surface warming by the time 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> doubles around year 70, and
the range of model results stays within roughly &#177 25% of the 
average model result throughout the experiments.
This rather narrow range contrasts with a greater spread of model output 
for experiments in which the models are allowed to reach equilibrium.
The typical statement for the equilibrium results (from IPCC reports and 
similar sources) is that the surface warms by 3.0 &#177 1.5 &#176C 
under doubled CO<SUB>2</SUB>.
While it is understandable that the ultimate equilibrium warming is greater
than the warming at the moment that CO<SUB>2</SUB> reaches twice is initial
value, it may seem surprising that the dispersion of results from different
models -- a factor of 3 in the equilibrium experiments -- is reduced to
&#177 25% in the time-evolving (or "transient") experiments considered here.
<P>
The precipitation responses of the models span a much wider range than the
temperature responses.
As shown in Figure 27, the increase in global and annual mean precipitation at
the time of CO<SUB>2</SUB> doubling varies from about 0.03 to 0.15 mm / day, a
factor of 5.
Although the global means of both precipitation and surface air temperature
increase in all of the enhanced-CO<SUB>2</SUB> simulations, the correlation 
between precipitation increases
and temperature increases is weak, as is the correlation between precipitation
inreases and the control run temperatures shown in the top panel of Figure 1.
<P>
Turning to geographical and latitude-height distributions, we recall that
the upper-right panels of Figures 2-21 display changes simulated by the
perturbation experiments.
Contour lines give the model-mean
difference between the first 20 year time mean and the last 20 year time mean of the 80
year simulations.
This difference is the change over
roughly 60 years during which time atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> nearly doubles.
The intermodel standard deviation (<I>sd<SUB>m</SUB></I>) of these 60 year differences
is used to normalize the model mean differences. Absolute values of the normalized 
difference greater than one are shaded and indicate that the changes simulated by the
models have a reasonable degree of consistency and therefore one might have
increased confidence in the results.
<P>
For surface air temperature <A HREF = "#Fig2Caption">(Figure 2)</A> 
there is a globally averaged model mean increase
of 1.73&#176C. The largest changes occur in the polar regions and over land areas. The
increases exceed <I>sd<SUB>m</SUB></I> by a factor of two over most of the globe. 
For mean sea level pressure <A HREF = "#Fig3Caption">(Figure 3)</A> 
the polar regions and land areas exhibit a decrease
and the oceans tend to exhibit an increase, an indicator of monsoon-like circulations
developing as a result of land areas warming faster than ocean areas.
The largest values of normalized sea level pressure difference are 
generally found in polar areas. 
Changes in precipitation <A HREF = "#Fig4Caption">(Figure 4)</A> 
show an increase over most of the globe. The globally averaged model mean increase is 0.07
mm / day. Only a few areas -- generally in the sub-tropics -- exhibit a decrease. The largest
values of normalized difference occur in high mid-latitudes and probably have an association
with storm tracks. 
Changes in net heat flux <A HREF = "#Fig5Caption">(Figure 5)</A> 
are generally positive,
indicating a slight gain of heat by the oceans. The largest values are present off the east
coast of North America and around Antarctica. 
The mean model change exceeds 
<I>sd<SUB>m</SUB></I> over only a small area off the coast of Antarctica, indicating 
that although models generally transport heat into the oceans in global warming scenarios,
the locations at which they do so vary. 
For the radiation components of
the heat balance <A HREF = "#Fig6Caption">(Figures 6-7),</A> 
the short wave flux exhibits little change while the 
upward long wave flux is generally reduced by amounts that
exceed the <I>sd<SUB>m</SUB></I>. 
Latent heat flux <A HREF = "#Fig8Caption">(Figure 8)</A> 
exhibits a general increase in accord with the increase in surface temperature 
while sensible heat flux <A HREF = "#Fig9Caption">(Figure 9)</A> decreases.
The models simulate an increase in
the fresh water flux in the tropics and high mid-latitudes and a decrease in sub-tropics
<A HREF = "#Fig10Caption">(Figure 10).</A> 
The changes are similar in sign to the control run results, indicating that dry areas
will become drier and wet areas wetter. Large normalized differences occur only off
Antarctica and in the Southern Hemisphere high pressure belt, however. For zonal wind stress
<A HREF = "#Fig11Caption">(Figure 11)</A> 
the model-mean change is small compared with <I>sd<SUB>m</SUB></I> nearly everywhere.
<P>
Changes in model mean
zonally averaged temperature as a function of height 
<A HREF = "#Fig12Caption">(Figure 12)</A> show the expected pattern
of warming in the troposphere and lower stratosphere and cooling in the remainder of
the stratosphere. Changes in large areas of the troposphere and the stratosphere are
more than twice <I>sd<SUB>m</SUB></I>. 
Model mean zonally averaged specific humidity 
<A HREF = "#Fig13Caption">(Figure 13)</A> 
increases everywhere and its changes are also large compared with <I>sd<SUB>m</SUB></I>,
consistent with the temperature changes.
For mean zonal wind
<A HREF = "#Fig14Caption">(Figure 14)</A> 
the main change is an increase in speed of the mid-latitude jets;
the models tend to agree on this change as indicated by the high levels of
normalized difference in the jet cores.
For the mass transport streamfunction 
<A HREF = "#Fig15Caption">(Figure 15)</A> 
the model mean shows a poleward
shift of the Ferrel cells and a slight strengthening of the Hadley Circulation.
<P>
Changes in model mean ocean temperature and salinity at 1000 meters depth are shown in 
<A HREF = "#Fig16Caption">Figures 16 and 17</A> 
respectively. In general, these changes are small. The models do produce consistent simulations of
slightly increased temperature and salinity off the coast of Antarctica. 
The model mean barotropic streamfunction 
<A HREF = "#Fig18Caption">(Figure 18)</A> 
decreases off Antarctica, 
indicating a slower Antarctic Circumpolar Current.
As a result of the large scatter among models, however,
the normalized differences are generally
small. 
Model mean global overturning streamfunction 
<A HREF = "#Fig19Caption">(Figure 19)</A>
and Atlantic overturning streamfunction 
<A HREF = "#Fig20Caption">(Figure 20)</A> decrease in magnitude,
and there is a reasonable degree of agreement among
the models. 
Results for ocean heat transport 
<A HREF = "#Fig21Caption">(Figure 21)</A> are displayed differently:
the solid line represents the model
mean difference and the dashed lines are one <I>sd<SUB>m</SUB></I> above and below the model mean.
The enhanced greenhouse effect acts to reduce the ocean heat transport,
consistent with the general slowdown in ocean circulation depicted in Figures 18-20.

<H3> 4. Conclusions </H3>
<P> 
Comparison of the CMIP2 control run output with observations of the
present day climate reveals improvements in coupled model performance
since the IPCC's mid-1990s assessment (Gates et al. 1996).
The most prominent of these is a diminishing need for arbitrary flux
adjustments at the air-sea interface.
About half of the newer generation of coupled models omit flux adjustments, yet
the rates of "climate drift" they exhibit (Figure 1) are within the
bounds required for useful model simulations on time scales of a
century or more.
The flux-adjusted models exhibit less drift on average, however, and
thus agree better with the limited information we possess on climate
variations before the Industrial Revolution (e.g., Jones et al. 1998;
Mann et al. 1999).
Both flux-adjusted and non-flux-adjusted models produce a surprising
variety of time-averaged global mean temperatures, from less than
12&#176C to over 16&#176C.
Perhaps
this quantity has not been the subject of as much attention as it
deserves in model development and evaluation.
<P>
The spatial patterns of model control run output variables display numerous
areas of agreement and disagreement with observations (Figures 2-21).
As always, it is difficult to determine whether 
or not the models are "good
enough" to be trusted when used to study climate in the distant past
or to make predictions of the future.
The global statistics shown in Figures 22-26 provide some
encouragement.
They indicate that the difference between a typical model simulation and a
baseline set of observations is not much greater than the difference
between different sets of observations.
To the extent that different sets of observations (including
model-based reanalyses) are equally reliable, this result implies that
coupled GCM control runs are nearly as accurate as observational
uncertainty allows them to be -- at least for the quantities
highlighted by our global statistics.
<P>
The CMIP2 models do not yield the same simulation of climate change
when they are all subjected to an identical scenario of 1% per year 
increasing CO<SUB>2</SUB>.
The range of model-simulated global mean warmings, however, is less 
than the factor of 3 (1.5 - 4.5&#176C) uncertainty commonly cited for
equilibrium warming under doubled CO<SUB>2</SUB>.
Part of the explanation could involve the behavior of models not 
included in this
report, which may give more extreme results than the CMIP2 models.
The main reason for the narrower range, however, is that the 
response time of the climate system increases with increasing climate 
sensitivity (Hansen et al. 1984, 1985; Wigley and Schlesinger 1985).
This relationship has been investigated in detail for the CMIP2
models by Raper et al. (2000).
It introduces a partial
cancellation of effects:
models with larger sensitivity (greater equilibrium warming to doubled
CO<SUB>2</SUB>) are farther from equilibrium than less-sensitive models
at any given time during the increasing-CO<SUB>2</SUB> scenario.
As a result, the uncertainty in model predictions of future climate
response may be less than the uncertainty in future anthropogenic forcing
(Hansen et al. 1997).
On the other hand, simultated precipitation increases differ greatly
among the CMIP2 models and appear to have no simple relationship with
simulated temperatures.
<P>
Expansion of the CMIP model output set has begun under auspices of the
JSC/CLIVAR Working Group on Coupled models, and analysis of the existing
database is continuing.
We encourage all interested scientists to contribute to this ongoing
effort.

Error statistics of surface air temperature, sea level pressure and precipitation. 
The radial coordinate gives the magnitude of total standard deviation, normalized by the observed 
value, and the angular coordinate gives the correlation with observations. It follows that the distance between the OBSERVED point and any model's point is proportional to the r.m.s. model error (Taylor 2000). Numbers indicate models counting from left to right in Figures 24-26. Letters indicate alternate observational data sets compared with the baseline observations: e = 15-year ECMWF/ERA reanalysis ("ERA15"); n = NCEP reanalysis.

Components of space-time errors in the climatological annual cycle of surface air temperature. Shown are the total error, the global and annual mean error ("bias"), the total r.m.s. ("pattern") error, and the following components (explained in Figure 23): zonal and annual mean ("clim.zm.am"); annual mean deviations from the zonal mean ("clim.zm.am.dv"), seasonal cycle of the zonal mean ("clim.zm.sc") and seasonal cycle of deviations from the zonal mean ("clim.zm.sc.dv"). For each component, errors are normalized by the component's observed standard deviation. The two left-most columns represent alternate observationally based data sets, ECMWF/ERA and NCEP reanalyses, compared with the baseline observations (Jones et al. 1999). Remaining columns give model results: the 10 models to the left of the second thick vertical line are flux adjusted and the 6 models to the right are not.
<P> <A NAME = "Fig25Caption" HREF = "psl_portrait.pdf">Fig. 25.</A> 
Same as Figure 24 for mean sea level pressure.
Baseline observations are from ECMWF/ERA reanalysis.
<P> <A NAME = "Fig26Caption" HREF = "pr_portrait.pdf">Fig. 26.</A> 
Same as Figure 24
for precipitation.
Baseline observations are from Xie and Arkin (1997).
<P> <A NAME = "Fig27Caption" HREF = "tseries.pdf">Fig. 27.</A> 
Globally averaged difference between increasing-CO<SUB>2</SUB> and control run values
of annual mean surface air temperature (top) and precipitation (bottom) for the CMIP2 models.
Compare with Figure 1, which gives control run values.
