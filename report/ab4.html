<h1>Report 4:&nbsp; Behavior of an Ocean General Circulation
Model at Four Different Horizontal Resolutions</h1>
<ul><b>Covey, </b>Curt
<br>August 1992, 30 pp.&nbsp;
<hr>A global ocean general circulation model is used to simulate the present-day
ocean climate using four different latitude/longitude grid spacings. Horizontal
resolution varies from l/2&deg; x l/2&deg;--the highest attained to date
in an ocean circulation model with global coverage--to a coarse 4&deg;
x 4&deg; grid traditionally used in climate modeling. This study addresses
the question of whether resolution of smaller scale circulations is necessary
in order to simulate the large scale ocean climate correctly. Results indicate
that large scale circulation is rather sluggish at 4&deg; x 4&deg; resolution
but surprisingly insensitive to grid spacing for resolutions finer than
2&deg; x 2&deg;, even considering the constraints imposed on the model
by surface boundary conditions and by "robust diagnostic" forcing near
the poles and below the thermocline. Simulated transport of heat from the
warm tropics to cooler higher latitudes is not overly sensitive to grid
spacing for resolutions finer than 2&deg; x 2&deg;. Furthermore, heat transport
does not increase at l/2&deg; x 1/2&deg; resolution when sub-gridscale
mixing of heat and momentum are altered so that mesoscale eddies appear
in the model.
<p>These results support inferences from earlier studies(based on simplified,
limited-domain circulation models) that mesoscale eddies make little net
contribution to poleward heat transport by the oceans. They suggest that
for global climate modeling, the substantial computer resources required
to explicitly resolve ocean mesoscale eddies might be better spent on improving
simulations of other components of the climate system. Making this conclusion
definite, however, requires a global ocean simulation that is fully eddy-resolving
and that relaxes the artificial constraints of the present simulation,
which tend to force the results toward present ocean climatology. <a href="pdf/rep4.pdf">(pdf
