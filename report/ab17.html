<h1>Report 17:&nbsp;&nbsp; The PCMDI Visualization and Computation
system (VCS): A Workbench for Climate Data Display and Analysis</h1>
<ul><b>Williams,</b> Dean N. and Robert L. Mobley
<br>March 1994, 107 pp.&nbsp;
<hr>This software was developed by the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis
and Intercomparison (PCMDI) at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
in Livermore, California. It was designed to provide some of the basic
capabilities needed for validating, comparing, and diagnosing climate model
behavior. It can be controlled either interactively, or from a script file,
or control can alternate between these modes during a session. A script
can be saved during an interactive session and merely replayed, or it can
be edited and replayed. The state-of-the-system can be dumped as a script
at any instant, and that script can be used later to restore that instant
of the session.
<p>A graphic display page is made up of one or more graphic pictures. Each
picture is defined by a picture template, a graphic method, and data. These
three elements are termed the "primary elements" in this application. The
picture template defines where to display; the graphic method defines how
to display; and the data defines what to display. Tables of attribute sets
have been created for each of the primary elements, and the application
provides the user with the capability for creating a picture by choosing
entries from these tables. Once a picture is created, it can be manipulated
by changing the choice of primary elements or by altering them. This application
also includes tables of basic elements that describe text, lines, markers,
fill areas, patterns, colormaps, and lists. These basic elements are used
to assign some of the attributes to the primary elements. This fact allows
a picture to be manipulated by choosing different basic elements or by
directly altering these basic elements.
<p>Attributes for data can describe variables existing in a file or variables
to be computed as a function of previously selected variables. The dimensions
of variables can be subselected, reversed, transposed, wrapped, and thinned
by selecting either a stride of nodes or by randomly selectring individual
nodes. Grid transformations are supported by allowing a different set of
dimension vectors to be specified in the dimension descriptors. A display
page can be output as either Adobe PostScript for hardcopy, or as a raster
image for hardcopy or animation.
