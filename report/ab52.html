<p>Brightness temperatures derived from polar orbiting satellites are valuable
for the evaluation of global climate models. However, the effect of orbital
constraints must be accounted to ensure valid comparisons. As part of the
AMIP II climate model comparisons, this study seeks to evaluate the bias
of possible model output sampling strategies, and whether they can be practically
implemented to provide meaningful comparisons with these satellite observations.
We compare various sampling strategies with a proxy satellite data set
constructed from model output and actual TOVS orbital trajectories, rather
than with the observations themselves. To a large extent, this enables
isolation of the sampling error from biases caused by deficiencies in the
modeled climate processes. Our results suggest that the traditional method
of calculating brightness temperatures from monthly mean temperature and
moisture profiles yields biases from both nonlinear effects and the removal
of the diurnal cycle, that may be unacceptable in many applications. However,
our results also suggest that a brightness temperature calculation every
six hours of the simulation provides substantially lower sampling biases
provided that there are two or more properly aligned satellites. This is
encouraging because it means for many applications modelers need not accurately
mimic actual satellite trajectories in the sampling of their simulations.
However, if only one satellite is available for comparison with simulations,
more sophisticated sampling seems necessary. For such circumstances, we
introduce a simple procedure that serves as a useful approximation to the
rather complex procedure required to sample a model exactly as a polar
orbiting satellite does the Earth.<i><a href="pdf/52.pdf">(pdf file)</a></i>
