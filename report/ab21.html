<hr>It has been hypothesized recently that regional-scale cooling caused
by anthropogenic sulfate aerosols may be partially obscuring a warming
signal associated with changes in greenhouse gas concentrations. Here we
use results from model experiments in which sulfate and carbon dioxide
have been varied individually and in combination in order to test this
hypothesis. We use centered <i>[R(t)]</i> and uncentered <i>[C(t)]</i>
pattern similarity statistics to compare observed time-evolving surface
temperature change patterns with the model-predicted equilibrium signal
patterns. We show that in most cases, the <i>C(t)</i> statistic reduces
to a measure of observed global-mean temperature changes, and is of limited
use in attributing observed climate changes to a specific causal mechanism.
We therefore focus on <i>[R(t)]</i>, which is a more useful statistic for
discriminating between forcing mechanisms with different pattern signatures
but similar rates of global mean change.
<p>Our results indicate that over the last 50 years, the summer (JJA) and
fall (SON) observed patterns of near-surface temperature change show increasing
similarity to the model-simulated response to combined sulfate aerosol/carbon
dioxide forcing. At least some of this increasing spatial congruence occurs
in areas where the real world has cooled. To assess the significance of
the most recent trends in <i>R(t)</i> and <i>C(t)</i>, we use data from
multi-century control integrations performed with two different coupled
atmosphere-ocean models, which provide information on the statistical behavior
of `unforced' trends in the pattern correlation statistics. For the combined
sulfate aerosol/carbon dioxide experiment, the 50-year <i>R(t)</i> trends
for the JJA and SON signals are highly significant. Results are robust
in that they do not depend on the choice of control run used to estimate
natural variability noise properties. The <i>R(t)</i> trends for the carbon
dioxide-only signal are not significant in any season. <i>C(t)</i> trends
for signals from both the carbon dioxide-only and combined forcing experiments
are highly significant in all seasons and for all trend lengths (except
for trends over the last 10 years), indicating large global-mean changes
relative to the two natural variability estimates used here.
<p>The caveats regarding the signals and natural variability noise which
form the basis of this study are numerous. Nevertheless, we have provided
first evidence that both the largest-scale (global-mean) and smaller-scale
(spatial anomalies about the global mean) components of a combined carbon
dioxide/anthropogenic sulfate aerosol signal are identifiable in the observed
near-surface air temperature data. If the coupled-model noise estimates
used here are realistic, we can be highly confident that the anthropogenic
signal that we have identified is distinctly different from internally-generated
natural variability noise. The fact that we have been able to detect the
detailed spatial signature in response to combined carbon dioxide and sulfate
aerosol forcing, but not in response to carbon dioxide forcing alone, suggests
that some of the regional-scale background noise (against which we were
trying to detect a carbon dioxide-only signal) is in fact part of the signal
of a sulfate aerosol effect on climate. The large effect of sulfate aerosols
found in this study demonstrates the importance of their inclusion in experiments
designed to simulate past and future climate change. <a href="pdf/rep21.pdf">(pdf
