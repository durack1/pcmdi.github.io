<h1>Report 6:&nbsp; Sensitivity of Dynamical Quantities to
Horizontal Resolution in a Climate Simulation with the ECMWF Atmospheric
General Circulation Model (Cycle 33)</h1>
<ul><b>Boyle, </b>James S.
<br>October 1992, 40 pp.&nbsp;
<hr>The ECMWF model (cycle 33) was integrated for a full seasonal cycle
at the four horizontal resolutions T21, T42, T63 and T106. Within the limits
imposed by the varying horizontal resolution, all other aspects of the
model were identical for each integration. In this paper a comparison is
made of the dynamical aspects of the simulations. Fields of zonally averaged
zonal wind, eddy heat and momentum fluxes, global divergent wind and vorticity,
and stationary wave patterns are presented and compared for each resolution.
<p>The conclusions reached by this study are: (1) T21 is qualitatively
different from the highter resolutions; (2) the highest resolution does
not provide a simulation which is egregiously superior to T42 and there
are aspects of the T21 simulation, especially in tropical convection, which
are clearly better than those of the higher resolutions; (3) aside from
differences in smaller scale boundary forcing at the higher resolutions,
the T42, T63, and T106 simulations are nearly identical in the dynamical
aspects of the circulation considered here; (5) increasing horizontal resolution
alone will evidently not result in an overall superior simulation unless
other aspects of the model are modified <i>pari passu</i>. <a href="pdf/rep6.pdf">(pdf
