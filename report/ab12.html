<hr>The ability of the ECMWF model (cycle 33) to simulate the Indian and
East Asian summer monsoon is evaluated at four different horizontal resolutions:
T21, T42, T63, and T106. Generally, with respect to the large scale features
of the circulation, the largest differences among the simulations occur
at T42 relative to T21. However, on regional scales, important differences
among the high frequency temporal variability serve as a further critical
test of the model's ability to simulate the monsoon. More generally, the
results indicate the importance of evaluating high frequency time scales
as a component of the climate sytem.
<p>T106 best captures both the spatial and temporal characteristics of
the Indian and East Asian Monsoon, while T42 fails to correctly simulate
the sequence and development of synoptic scale milestones that characterize
the monsoon flow. In particular, T106 is superior at simulating the development
and migration of the monsoon trough over the Bay of Bengal. In the T42
simulation, the development of the monsoon occurs one month earlier than
typically observed. At this time the trough is incorrectly located adjacent
to the east coast of India which results in an underestimate of precipitation
over the Burma/Thailand region. This early establishment of the monsoon
trough affects the evolution of the East-Asian monsoon and yields excessive
preseason rainfall over the Mei-yu region. EOF analysis of precipitation
over China indicates that T106 best simulates the Mei-yu mode of variability
associated with an oscillation of the rainband that gives rise to periods
of enhanced rainfall over the Yangtze River Valley. The coarse resolution
of T21 precludes simulation of the aforementioned regional scale monsoon
flows. <a href="pdf/rep12.pdf">(pdf file)</a>
