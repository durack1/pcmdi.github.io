Tropical Convection in the ECMWF Model</h1>

<hr>Extended (180-day) high resolution (T106) perpetual January and July
integrations of the ECMWF model have been analyzed in terms of the spatial
and temporal characteristics of the model's convective activity in the
tropics. The model's outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) is used as a surrogate
for convective activity, consistent with similar studies based on satellite
observations. The 3-hourly temporal sampling is sufficient to allow diagnosis
of intra- and interdiurnal variability; the length of the integrations
is adequate for identifying lower frequency intraseasonal phenomena. Wherever
possible, use is made of the results from surface or satellite observations
of the temporal characteristics of convection to verify the model results.
<p>At intradiurnal time scales, the model captures the amplitude and phase
of the diurnal harmonic over both land and sea. The largest amplitudes
occur over the summer continents, with contrasting phases of maximum OLR
depending on the presence of convective activity. Over the oceans, the
model show a coherent structure to the diurnal cycle associated with regions
of convection.
<p>Analysis of synoptic (2 to 10 days) and low frequency (greater than
10 days) variability shows that in many instances the model agrees well
with observations. For both seasons, the model simulates westward moving
phenomena over the oceans whose phase speed is reasonable. In July, these
easterly waves display well-defined periodicities in agreement with observations,
whilst in January they are more episodic. Low frequency variability is
more prevalent in January, particularly over the convectively active regions
of the eastern hemisphere. In general, this variability has a larger spatial
scale than synoptic variability; its periodicities, some in excess of 30
days, are typical of intraseasonal time scales. <a href="pdf/rep2.pdf">(pdf
