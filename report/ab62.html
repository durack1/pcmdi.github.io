<br>Abstract
<p>Correlations of tropical mean water vapor with its surface values have
been calculated for all AMIP1 models and some of the AMIP2 models. The
previously noted discrepancy between the GFDL model and rawinsonde data
also exists for other models: the interannual correlations of water vapor
with its surface values decline to much smaller values in observations
than in the models. This discrepancy is reduced somewhat after the data
from the models were sampled the same way as the data from observations,
but remains large even at levels low enough to trust raw-insonde data.
