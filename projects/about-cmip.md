## Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP)

CMIP, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, is the analog of AMIP for global coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models. CMIP began in 1995 under the auspices of the [Working Group on Coupled Modelling](http://www.wmo.int/files/WCRP_WEB/AP_Modelling_WGCM.html) (WGCM), -- which is in turn under auspices of CLIVAR and the Joint Scientific Committee for the [World Climate Research Programme](http://wcrp.wmo.int/). The PCMDI supports CMIP by helping WGCM to determine the scope of the project, by maintaining the project's data base, and by participating in data analysis.

### CMIP Phase 5 (CMIP5) and the IPCC AR5.

The purpose of CMIP5 experiments is to address outstanding scientific questions that arose as part of the IPCC AR4 (the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment Report) process, improve understanding of climate, and to provide estimates of future climate change that will be useful to those considering its possible consequences.
The IPCCâ€™s AR5 is now scheduled to be published in early 2013.

*For details visit the new [CMIP5 webpage]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/cmip5/).*

### CMIP Phase 3 (CMIP3) and the IPCC AR4.

CMIP3 output from coupled ocean-atmosphere model simulations of 20th - 22nd century climate is being collected by the PCMDI in support of research relied on by the 4th Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). CMIP has received model output from the pre-industrial climate simulations ("control runs") and 1% per year increasing-CO2 simulations of about 30 coupled GCMs. More recent phases of the project (20C3M, ...) include more realistic scenarios of climate forcing.
