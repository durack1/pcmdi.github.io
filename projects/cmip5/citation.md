# Proper citation and acknowledgement


In order to document CMIP5’s impact and enable ongoing support of CMIP, you are obligated to acknowledge CMIP5 and the participating modeling groups. The CMIP5 model output should be referred to as "the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble [archive/output/results/of simulations/dataset/ ...]". In publications, you should include a table (referred to below as Table XX) listing the models and institutions that provided model output used in your study. In this table and as appropriate in figure legends, you should use the CMIP5 “official” model names found in "CMIP5 Modeling Groups and their Terms if Use" ( pdf document, also in Word doc format). In addition, an acknowledgment similar to the following should be included in your publication:

*“We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modelling, which is responsible for CMIP, and we thank the climate modeling groups (listed in Table XX of this paper) for producing and making available their model output. For CMIP the U.S. Department of Energy's Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison provides coordinating support and led development of software infrastructure in partnership with the Global Organization for Earth System Science Portals.”*

Where “*Table XX*” in your paper should list the models and modeling groups that provided the data you used.

In addition it may be appropriate to cite one or more of the CMIP5 experiment design articles listed on the [CMIP5 reference page](http://pcmdi-cmip.llnl.gov/cmip5/cmip5_references.html).

Besides the above acknowledgement, you should register any journal articles (or other scientific documents) that are based on CMIP5 results at CMIP5 Publications. Registering your paper(s) will make IPCC authors as well as other researchers aware of your work. More importantly it will serve to document the scientific impact of CMIP5, which is of vital importance for securing future funding to support both the modeling groups and software infrastructure of CMIP. You should consider this an obligation if you have taken advantage of the CMIP5 archive, which represents the end product of considerable effort by the modeling groups and others.

For the first time in CMIP, Digital Object Identifiers (DOI’s used, for example, in journal citations) will be assigned to various subsets of the CMIP5 multi-model dataset and, when available and as appropriate, users should cite these references in their publications. These DOI’s will provide a traceable record of the analyzed model data, as tangible evidence of their scientific value. Instructions will be forthcoming on how to cite the data using DOI’s.
