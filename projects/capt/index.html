<h2><a name="Intro"></a> Introduction </h2>
<p><strong>The Cloud-Associated Parameterizations Testbed (CAPT)</strong> aims to diagnose and improve the representation in climate models of cloud-associated physical processes. In the CAPT, weather forecast techniques are applied to climate models , with an emphasis on the simulations of the Community Atmosphere Model. We will be extending the concept of weather forecasts from the atmosphere to the fully coupled ocean-atmosphere model. Three foci of the project include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Comparing of model simulations to detailed process observations available from the ARM data</li>
  <li>Diagnosing the origin of errors in model simulations of climate</li>
  <li>Testing new model parameterizations in order to identify their strengths/weaknesses  in simulating cloud-associated processes.</li>
  </ul>
  
<p>
CAPT is a joint project of the Atmospheric System Research (<a href="http://asr.science.energy.gov/">ASR</a>) and Regional and Global Climate Modeling (<a href="http://science.energy.gov/ber/research/cesd/regional-and-global-modeling/">RGCM</a>) Programs of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science/Biological and Environmental Research (<a href="http://science.energy.gov/ber/">BER</a>). We are using analyses of global weather from numerical weather prediction (NWP) centers, in conjunction with field observations such as those provided by the <a href="http://www.arm.gov/">Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Climate Research Facility</a>, to evaluate parameterizations of sub-gridscale processes in global climate models.<em> Simply stated, we run realistically initialized climate models in forecast mode to determine their initial drift from the NWP analyses and/or from the available field data, thereby gaining insights on model parameterization deficiencies. </em></p>
<p>
<strong>Prior to February 2010</strong>, CAPT was known as the <strong>CCPP-ARM Parameterization Testbed</strong>. </p>
